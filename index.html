    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>Imagining recipes found in anime with the themes below.Picking from whatever I've recently watched or a favourite(Disastrous Life of Saiki).
      Ironically Saiki's recipe is not in the Disaster section.
    </p>

    <h2>Disaster</h2>
    <p>The Disaster theme features an anime that is pot full of disastrous events, Attack on Titan. The recipe is for a baked potato: The first thing we see Sasha eat in Attack on Titan. R.I.P Sara</p>

    <h2>Humility</h2>
    <p>Although there is no such thing as a recipe for humility, this section features an anime where I feel like characters often get humbled, Jujutsu Kaisen.
      The following is a word for word, bar for bar translated recipe of Itadori Yuuji's Meatballs. Please enjoy.
