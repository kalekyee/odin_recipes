    <h3 class="humility_h0">Description.</h3>
    <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is one of those shows where most characters over-estimate just how powerful they are. This mostly leads to a rude awakening where they are humbled and humiliated by superior power. 
      This phenomenon has inspired this page. Featuring Itadori Yuuji's <i>famous</i> meatballs and great love for the show, the translated version is hereby written below:
      This recipe is for meatballs used in hotpot. Use with caution.
