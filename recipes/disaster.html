    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>Attack on Titan is as intruiging as it is disastrous. Through all the hardship, most of the top characters survived, until Sasha was shot by some dumb kid who got way too much screen time and for some reason is still alive. In Sasha's loving memory, we shall share a recipe for her first dish on the show and disdain for her murderer, whose name shall not be mentioned.
